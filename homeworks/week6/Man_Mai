// I find this problem is quite tricky
// My approach is that we I try to compare the identify the string s that include all the characters in T. String that sastifies this condition is called Good String
// Then I continuously compare the current Good String with previous one everytime I detect a new Good String and return the shortest Good String.
// after Finishing for looking all the GoodString, I return the shortest one.

//Based on the this approach, I expect the time complexity will be O(n^2)
//while the space complexity will be at most O(n) for saving the Good String.

//Due to the difficulty of this problem, I only describe my approach only. Hope you don't mind :))
